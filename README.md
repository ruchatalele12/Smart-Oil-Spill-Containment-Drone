# Smart-Oil-Spill-Containment-Drone-
In this project we designed a drone and a raft system to contain huge oil spills. We used a CNN model, feature matching using SIFT and SURF and Contour algorithms to effectively detect presence of oil. A motorized funnel is attached to the drone. Whenever presence of oil is detected, the funnel slit opens and Spill Sorb (oil absorbent) is sprayed over the oil region. Spill Sorb is a completely bio-degradable and eco-friendly material which adsorbs oil and makes it non-flammable. Later, a semi autonomous raft flows through water and collects the oil and spill sorb mixture.
